    [Verse 1: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
    Come with me, I got booze and that drip misting<br>
    Cut Wock' and the cost is fifteen<br>
    Life flew past too fast<br>
    Old stomach is the new ass<br>
    He can't afford you, that's too bad<br>
    Told her what you gon' do with a durag?<br>
    Fuck the lame, do you write down the names?<br>
    You was stuck, run in place<br>
    You ain't runnin' with the strays no more<br>
    Roxanne, you don't have to put on<br>
    Yeah, I got that shit on<br>
    Give me somethin' to spit on<br>
    Roxanne, you don't have to race after the red light<br>
    I got that pump, but it's off on the headlights<br>
    Fuck the lame, do you write and your girlfriend think I'm dope?<br>
    Really? Thanks<br>
    Dark skin nigga only shootin' Billy Blanks<br>

    [Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
    Baby, you're the hottest in the city<br>
    You got my attention when you're with me<br>
    All this Spanish spinning got us dizzy<br>
    Dollars all she do it for<br>
    I throw this cash, you shake that ass<br>
    Get that upfront, just throw it back<br>
    It's just the job and that's a shame<br>
    You made it plain, you keep on sayin'<br>

    Ladies, go and choose your man<br>
    There's no need to be afraid<br>
