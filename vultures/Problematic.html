    [Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
    I feel like I beat a murder, murder<br>
    Fuckin' on a bitch you never heard of, heard of<br>
    <br>
    [Verse 1: Kanye West]<br>
    That Pope like the leader of the Vatican, he do it again?<br>
    Everything I do, they do, guess Yeezy set the trend<br>
    And we in this bitch again, time to get rich again (Throw your motherfuckin' hands)<br>
    They lookin' like prey, I guess that's why they prayin'<br>
    And when you flyin' private, it can't be no delayin'<br>
    When I speak my mind, it's gon' be some lawsuits and furniture movin'<br>
    I gotta haul through like when you be movin'<br>
    I gotta fly to Japan just to be secluded<br>
    They did no damage, what I give 'em? No chances<br>
    Even if they get a chance, here's panic like they know Spanish<br>
    How I brand all of these clothes?<br>
    How every tantrum I throw make an anthem for hoes?<br>
    This my life, not a quote<br>
    <br>
    [Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
    I feel like I beat a murder, murder<br>
    Fuckin' on a bitch you never heard of, heard of<br>
    <br>
    [Verse 2: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
    I'ma take all my baldies to Giorgio Baldis<br>
    Throw my dick a party<br>
    Your dress code upscale, used to shop at Aldis<br>
    I ran up some numbers, now I got what you all need<br>
    Give your homegirl the boric acid, save the summer<br>
    New abs, she droppin' fast, it's time to come up<br>
    Black out<br>
    Passin' out and then she wakin' up gorgeous<br>
    I'm not racist, it's a preference<br>
    And my bitch lookin' like a reference<br>
    Don't I make the rules like a referee?<br>
    Come get on your knees, shawty, I got needs<br>
    She a loud mouth<br>
    I need to sign and seal a couple brand new deals<br>
    Gotta get this shit off my chest, I got some shit to spill<br>
    Passin' out NDAs, nigga, deal with it after<br>
    I just fucked the world raw, she need a morning after<br>
    And then the morning after<br>
    And I quote, "It's only one G.O.A.T.," let you have your fun, though<br>
    Run the block like Mutombo, you had it on loan<br>
    Every day in New Jersey, on my way to New York<br>
    I was late to every meeting, in my queen's tunnel<br>
    But all the hoes in Hoboken know<br>
    If I seent you outside with the open-toes<br>
    You might get you a trip to the Poconos<br>
    You might have to tell your man a Pinocchio<br>
    That was a jokey-joke<br>
    That wasn't nowhere near as funny when you brokey-broke<br>
    Crying in high school over a high school bitch<br>
    And she still in the dark takin' night school, bitch<br>
    Look at how we made it like we Mike WiLL, bitch<br>
    Wish somebody woulda warned us<br>
    When I was fifteen, my soulmate wasn't born yet<br>
    African king in a different time<br>
    We got multiple wives too, just at different times<br>
    Picture this, if every room got a different bitch<br>
    Do that make me a po-nigga-mist?<br>
    Without the deals, I guarantee I'm still nigga rich<br>
    Shit is fuckin' ridiculous<br>
