    This that shit that make rap niggas mad, yeah<br>

    So she took out all the ass, kept it natural (Yeah)<br>
    But that thing still movin', I had to knock it down<br>
    Yeezy, where we at? (Where we at?)<br>
    Florence to Milan<br>
    Just turned a bird bitch to my ex like I was Elon<br>
    Count hundreds on the blue side, booty must've grew in size<br>
    Seen it from the front side, damn, it must be two-sized (Yeah)<br>
    Goddamn it, must be two sides<br>
    Forgis on the Double R, I'm floatin' like a cruise line<br>
    Bitches wanna fuck me, then trap me, then fuck me over<br>
    She cryin' tears in that Maybach and not the Toyota<br>
    Once it's over, then she dead to me, give that ho a memorial<br>
    Suck my dick for the interview, a headitorial<br>
    Put you on a track, have you workin' like I appointed you<br>
    Ho, how you gon' go blockin' your blessing when I anointed you?<br>
    Beautiful big titty, butt-naked bitches, where you at? Uh<br>
    Started off trippin', tell her, "Pay tuition", no congrats, uh<br>
    Winin' and dinin', now to take my ratchet ho to Saks, uh<br>
    She was too used to Hamburger Helper, chilli mac<br>
    And that's facts, you can fact-check it<br>
    I'm from the crack era<br>
    Redbone bitches, they king me like I'm a black checker<br>
    Standin' at the plate, your ho catchin' balls like a back catcher<br>
    I bring my pistol when I fuck her 'cause it's all 'bout survival, ho<br>
    I'll gut you clean, I bet you fuck with my rivals, though<br>
    Put that on everything, a whole stack of bibles, ho<br>
    Real niggas like me just don't fall out the sky, you know<br>
    So keep vibin', ho<br>
    And you know that's facts, you can fact-check it<br>
    I'm from the crack era<br>
    Where niggas run off and work it, don't bring it back era<br>
    Standin' at the plate, your ho catchin' balls like a back catcher<br>
    <br>
    <br>
