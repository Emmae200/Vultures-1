    [Chorus: Rich The Kid with Choir, Ty Dolla $ign & Playboi Carti]<br>
    Go, go, go, go<br>
    Head so good, she a honor roll<br>
    She'll ride the dick like carnival<br>
    I done did the impossible<br>
    Go, go, go, go (Ha, ha)<br>
    Head so good, she a honor roll<br>
    She'll ride the dick like carnival<br>
    I done did the impossible (Dolla $ign)<br>
    <br>
    [Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
    She ride it like Six Flags<br>
    We turn up to the max<br>
    I whop her from the back<br>
    I gave that bitch a cramp<br>
    They love me out in France<br>
    In the hood, I'm good, I'm stamped<br>
    Every day, I dress all black<br>
    For a show, nine hundred racks<br>
    Middle East call, double that<br>
    On my neck a bubble bath<br>
    On my wrist, new Cadillac<br>
    Cut her off, don't want her back<br>
    Little bitch, I'm a superstar<br>
    These hoes wanna fuck my car<br>
    My dog put a nigga in park<br>
    Gotta watch out for the narcs, ayy<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    [Verse 3: Kanye West]<br>
    This that Game of Thrones, Yeezy, not the clones<br>
    Elon, where my rocket ship? It's time to go home<br>
    They served us the porn since the day we was born<br>
    Anybody pissed off, gotta make 'em drink the urine<br>
    Now I'm Ye-Kelly, bitch, now I'm Bill Cosby, bitch<br>
    Now, I'm Puff Daddy rich, that's Me Too me rich<br>
    Why she say she sucked my dick? Then she say she ain't sucked my dick?<br>
    She gon' take it up the ass like a ventriloquist<br>
    I mean since Taylor Swift, since I had the Rollie on the wrist<br>
    I'm the new Jesus, bitch, I turn water to Cris'<br>
    This for what they did to Chris, they can't do shit with this<br>
    Got my kids in a fake school, we ain'tâ€”<br>
    <br>
    [Chorus: Rich The Kid with Choir & Playboi Carti]<br>
    Go, go, go, go<br>
    Head so good, she a honor roll<br>
    She'll ride the dick like carnival (Schyeah)<br>
    I done did the impossible (Schyeah)<br>
    Go, go, go, go<br>
    Head so good, she a honor roll<br>
    She'll ride the dick like carnival<br>
    I done did the impossible<br>
    <br>
    [Verse 4: Playboi Carti]<br>
    She ride the dick like a carnival<br>
    Bend her over, havin' flashbacks, she gon' eat me up like a carnivore<br>
    It's the way I pop my shit, the hoes not ready, I'm goin' barnacles<br>
    Movin', I feel like I'm Jason, can't get arrested, I make 'em stumble<br>
    She want a private section, roll off them X's when I'm on Melrose<br>
    She tatted my name on her titties, yeah, you can bust it, but it's a borrow<br>
    Hol' up, sittin' back, countin' up dubs, I was raised in the borough<br>
    She wanna taste it, checkin' the swag today, ho, come back tomorrow<br>
    If you know what I know, hide your ho<br>
    Just off the facts that we havin' them hunchos<br>
    Runnin' around in the lobby, I know that they tired of me havin' like ten hoes<br>
    She need some cresidentials just to be presidential, hol' up, hol' up<br>
    I'm 'bout to buy her some dentures, make that ho eat me for dinner, woah, woah<br>
    Pain all in my eyes, I can't see, uh<br>
    I'm 'bout to jump out my body, I'm ready to leap, uh<br>
    I'm 'bout to nut on her body and tell the ho leave, 'kay<br>
    Fifty mil' stuffed in the bag, tell the whole gang eat, uh<br>
    It's Ye and Barti, tell me who fuckin' with we?<br>
    I'm hot like Tha Carter, I'm feelin' that ho in my sleep<br>
    Dollar signs all in my dreams, I don't never see Z's, woah (Woah-woah)<br>
    The swag cover my body like it's a disease, woah (Woah-woah)<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    [Bridge: Choir]<br>
    Woah, woah, woah<br>
    Woah, woah, woah<br>
    <br>
    [Chorus: Choir]<br>
    Go, go, go, go<br>
    Head so good, she a honor roll<br>
    She ride the dick like a carnival<br>
    I done did the impossible<br>
    Go, go, go, go<br>
    Head so good, she a honor roll<br>
    She ride the dick like a carnival<br>
    I done did the impossible<br>
    <br>
    [Outro: Choir]<br>
    Go, go, go, go<br>
    Go, go, go, go<br>
    Go, go, go, go<br>
    Go, go, go, go<br>
