    Won't tell no lies, won't hold my tongue<br>
    Don't cry for me<br>
    (This Chicago, nigga)<br>
    (I want some juice)<br>
    I don't have no rapper friends, I hang with the vultures<br>
    Big ass toaster, hit you with it, flip it over<br>
    Big ol' nigga, he's a big ol' goofy, Rudy Gobert<br>

    I just got some head in a Ghost, then I ghost her<br>
    Yeah, yeah, outta here, your boyfriend a gopher<br>
    I see him out with her and pretend like I don't know her<br>
    I can't do no features with you, nigga, it's a "No, sir"<br>
    Hardest nigga on Earth, I'm not really from Earth<br>
    We don't dial 9-1-1, I let off that chrome first<br>
    I put in my own work, better do your homework<br>
    I can hear that money calling, I pick up the first ring<br>
    What, you gon' charge that old man for that pussy? Girl, don't hurt me (this Chicago, nigga)<br>
    Three gang leaders with me, all times<br>

    Brody, tell me who them hoes is, man, they all fine<br>
    Runnin' hooligans, and we with the foolishness<br>
    How I'm antisemitic? I just fucked a Jewish bitch<br>
    I just fucked Scooter's bitch and we ran up like Olympics<br>
    Got pregnant in the threesome, so whose baby is it?<br>
    Whose baby is it?<br>
    My niggas puttin' belt to ass, pull up with the switches<br>
    This ain't Jimmy Butler but the heat got extensions<br>
    This ain't Columbine, but we came in with the trenches<br>
    She askin' me to aim for her neck, 'cause her boyfriend bought that necklace (with the trenches)<br>
    Precious (with the trenches)<br>
    Fuck it, I scratched another nigga woman up off my checklist (with the trenches)<br>
    I've been livin' reckless<br>
    I wish Takeoff wasn't there that night in Houston, Texas (with the trenches)<br>
    Wish I could bring G.Ca$$o back, that was my best friend<br>
    Boys, I need you to give me somethin' big, I'm talkin' 'bout dollar signs<br>
    Skinny pants flow, tell the hoe "No, I don't wanna fuck"<br>
    She can suck-suck-suck it, 'til she suck it dry<br>
    California nigga with some European freaks<br>
    Badass bitch from the Middle E-E-E-E-East wanna lick on me<br>

    Even though she got a man, she know he ain't as pure as me, seriously<br>
    Soon as I get back, trading in my Urus for the Puro' keys<br>
    Couple grey hairs up in my beard, that's showin' my maturity, yeah<br>

    Bought her a bag and I filled it with loose change<br>
    Just like my exes, she told me that "You changed," yeah, yeah, yeah<br>

    Still screamin' "Free TC, Melly, and Thug"<br>
    Fuck the police, the DA and the judge<br>
    Way out in Saudi, I found me a plug<br>
    Don't wanna go out, she'd rather do drugs<br>
