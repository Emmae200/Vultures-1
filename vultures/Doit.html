    [Intro: Nipsey Hussle]<br>
    Do it stay waxed?<br>
    Do it smell fresh?<br>
    Can I feel your juice through the latex?<br>
    If you go 'round, do you stay wet?<br>
    Can your homegirl watch? Can she go next?<br>
    Need the lights on, tell her watch this<br>
    When I make you cream, I'ma talk shit (I just wanna know)<br>
    And you fuck back, and you got grip<br>
    Stick your tongue out when you get your spot hit<br>
    I just wanna know<br>
    <br>
    [Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
    All this money on the floor<br>
    Ten racks, throw it up<br>
    Watch how I do it, make her drop to her toes<br>
    Bend it over, pick it up real slow<br>
    I do it, baby, do it<br>
    Up that work, ice like a jacuzzi<br>
    In my bag, call me '06 Gucci<br>
    What's happenin'? Tryna make a movie?<br>
    <br>
    [Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
    Just touched down, feelin' like Lucci<br>
    Fuckin' on Tisha, fuckin' on Suzi<br>
    Don't discriminate with this Uzi<br>
    She just wanna drink, do a lil' tuci<br>
    Beat it all day, beat it all night<br>
    I be on gorilla, goin' Kimbo Slice<br>
    I be with the killers, need to pay your fines<br>
    Try me once, you gon' pay with your life<br>
    All these dimes on me<br>
    What's your set? Bitch, throw it up<br>
    Heard you got a man, but he ain't like us<br>
    Your bitty bands ain't doin' enough<br>
    Know it's all on me<br>
    This might make you fall in love<br>
    Tellin' your friends you found the one<br>
    And I'm like "Who?" and I'm like "What?"<br>
    <br>
    [Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
    All this money on the floor<br>
    Ten racks, throw it up<br>
    Watch how I do it, make her drop to her toes<br>
    Bend it over, pick it up real slow<br>
    I do it, baby, do it<br>
    Up that work, ice like a jacuzzi<br>
    In my bag, call me '06 Gucci<br>
    What's happenin'? Tryna make a movie?<br>

    [Verse 2: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
    You don't like it? That's your loss<br>
    Your opinion don't change the show cost<br>
    Let me know what these hoes cost<br>
    I ain't finna pay the whole cost<br>
    Throwin' so much money, you gon' need an audit<br>
    God in me, so anything you want, I got it<br>
    Southside, Do or Die, Chi-Town top five<br>
    Four, three, two, one, who am I?<br>
    Ye, that's Ye-Ye<br>
    Text a ho a hunnid K, Apple payday<br>
    If I show up where she work, I think she just might quit<br>
    I just bought my bitch a bitch, uh<br>
    Spendin' all this money like it's free to me<br>
    That shit fall off trees to me<br>
    We ain't even stress, we the new kings and sheikhs<br>
    We done made a mess they gon' have to clean for weeks<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    [Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Kanye West]<br>
    All this money on the floor (Yee)<br>
    Ten racks, throw it up<br>
    Watch how I do it, make her drop to her toes<br>
    Bend it over, pick it up real slow<br>

    Pullin' out the tracks, she gotta glue it (She gotta glue it)<br>
    Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, she choosy (She what?)<br>
    Fuck her like I love her, I'm confusin' (I would)<br>
    She don't wanna go home, she refusin'<br>

    Top boy, I ain't the lil' one<br>
