[Intro: Chris Brown]<br>
You've gone too far<br>
You've gone too far and you should hang your head in shame<br>
For these wounds, I cannot stay, you've gone too far<br>
You've gone too far<br>
<br>
[Refrain: Chris Brown]<br>
Wide awake and I can't hear my heartbeat<br>
Hope it cradles me and rocks my heart to sleep<br>
Protector in the light and a stranger in the dark<br>
You don't say anything more<br>
Bound by suffocating secrets I must keep<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]<br>
You've gone too far<br>
You've gone too far and you should hang your head in shame<br>
For these wounds, I cannot stay, you've gone too far<br>
You've gone too far<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Chris Brown]<br>
Sum of all the parts that you have taken<br>
Are a fraction of the parts that make me whole<br>
For he was stronger than I was<br>
But it's strength you can't sustain<br>
Do not come to give me counsel<br>
You should beg forgiveness of me<br>
<br>
<br>
[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]<br>
You should beg forgiveness<br>
You should beg forgiveness<br>
You should beg forgiveness<br>
You should beg forgiveness of me<br>
<br>
[Refrain: Chris Brown, Chris Brown & Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
Wide awake and I can't hear my heartbeat<br>
Hope it cradles me and rocks my heart to sleep<br>
Protector in the light and a stranger in the dark<br>
He don't say anything more<br>
Bound by suffocating secrets I must keep<br>
<br>
[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ty Dolla Sign]<br>
You've gone too far<br>
You've gone too far and you should hang your head in shame<br>
For these wounds, I cannot stay, you've gone too far<br>
You've gone too far<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Chris Brown, Chris Brown & Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
Sum of all the parts that you have taken<br>
Are a fraction of the parts that make me whole<br>
For he was stronger than I was<br>
But it's strength you can't sustain<br>
Do not come to give me counsel<br>
You should beg forgiveness of me<br>
<br>
<br>
[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]<br>
You should beg forgiveness<br>
You should beg forgiveness<br>
You should beg forgiveness<br>
You should beg forgiveness of me<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Kanye West]<br>
Fuck it up one time<br>
I know what you want, I'm readin' the signs<br>
Don't let your moment pass you by<br>
Don't let your moment pass you by<br>
Had to go in my whole life<br>
A hundred percent covered in ice<br>
Put down your phone, cut off the lights, lights<br>
Cut off the lights, covered in ice<br>
And if I go tonight, know that I lived a lovely life<br>
Just make sure my kids are right and it is alright<br>
And if I go tonight, just know I lived a lovely life<br>
Tell my kids to live they life how they wanna live they life<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Choir]<br>
Forgiveness, beg forgiveness<br>
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness<br>
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness<br>
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness<br>
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness<br>
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness<br>
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness<br>
Beg forgiveness<br>
<br>
<br>
[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
Say you wanna make amends before I go<br>
Now you wanna put your heart on the line<br>
God knows the way you are<br>
I will wait<br>
I will wait, I will wait, I will wait<br>
I will wait<br>
I will wait, I will wait<br>
I will wait, I will wait<br>
I will wait, don't wait, I will wait<br>
I will wait<br>
I will wait<br>
I will wait<br>
Now you wanna be so sad<br>
Wanna be with me so bad after driving me so mad<br>
Yeah, you know, I'm still suffocating on your every lie<br>
Yeah, you know, I'm still wakin' up with murder on my mind<br>
Yeah, you know, I'm still suffocating on your every lie<br>
Yeah, you know, I'm still wakin' up with murder on my mind<br>
And you know<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Choir & Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness (Oh-ah-ah)<br>
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness (Oh-ah-ah)<br>
Beg forgiveness, beg forgiveness (Oh-ah-ah)<br>
Beg forgiveness (Oh-ah-ah)<br>
Beg forgiveness<br>
<br>
