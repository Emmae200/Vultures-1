    [Intro]<br>
Slow down<br>
<br>
[Verse 1: Kanye West]<br>
Slow down, you on your way to an overdose<br>
Plus these texts gettin' way too emoji-nal<br>
Way too much time alone<br>
Told the guys that you know I'm headed home, I got a trauma bond<br>
Look at what I stumbled on<br>
Another nigga chillin' on your couch with pajamas on<br>
Thought I was the only one<br>
How dare you have a nigga in your house eatin' Papa Johns?<br>
Where you get that money from?<br>
Lookin' at how far we come, I bought your first Vacheron<br>
Guess we had an awesome run<br>
Ever since I lost my mom, you was like my foster mom<br>
Hold me like your only son<br>
Hold me like the homies in the Chi' when they hold they guns<br>
Hold me like a trophy in the sky when they know they won<br>
<br>
[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign with Kanye West]<br>
Wasn't it always this way?<br>
Wasn't it always this way?<br>
Puttin' it all on display<br>
Usin' up all your sick days<br>
Put up with all my mistakes<br>
Listen to all my mixtapes<br>
'Posed to be always this way<br>
'Posed to be always this way<br>
<br>


[Verse 2: Kanye West]<br>
Couldn't it all be so simple?<br>
I could've used that last part for the intro<br>
How it sound when you got Yeezy over Timbo?<br>
From Uptown, but now she rockin' Yeezys over Timbos<br>
Like you don't see me beatin' on your window<br>
Like Chief Keef in the kitchen with the BDs and the endo<br>
But that was me when I was burnin' CDs for my friends though<br>
Now, I can't just take it on the chin like Jay Leno<br>
Now, everybody want the info<br>
These bitches want the pin code, these niggas swear we kinfolk<br>
In a Benzy with a Gen-Z gettin' gentle<br>
If I gotta pay for it, I'ma drive it like a rental<br>
You already know my M.O.<br>
Is you ready for the Venmo? You already know my demo<br>
You already know I'm impulsive<br>
And another baby is my end goal<br>
<br>
[Outro: India Love]<br>
I wanna give you keys to my life, to my life, to my life, uh<br>
I wanna give you keys to my life, to my life, to my life, yeah (Ah-hahahaha)<br>
I wanna give you keys to my life, to my life, to my life, yeah<br>
