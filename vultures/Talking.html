    [Part II: ONCE AGAIN]<br>
    <br>
    [Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
    Once again, the clouds are gatherin' to release what they held in (Ooh)<br>
    What they held in (Held in)<br>
    What they held in (Held in)<br>
    What they held in (Held in)<br>
    <br>
    [Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
    Once again, the clouds are gatherin' to release what they held in (Again, once—, yeah)<br>
    Once again, the clouds are gatherin' to release what they held in<br>
    <br>
    [Verse: Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
    How much to stop the clock from speedin'? They might try to slow down<br>
    How much to stop my daughter from growin'? I just can't take it now<br>
    'Cause she just doing all the shit I did when I was her age<br>
    I don't know how I'm gonna tell her, but her dad's just afraid<br>
    Of her choices, know that I've been through it<br>
    I just hope I haven't been the wrong influence<br>
    Put her on game before the world put her through it<br>
    Ooh-ooh, oh-oh<br>
    That's why I gotta break the curses that were sent for me<br>
    This is hard work working, this ain't destiny<br>
    My motivation is just lookin' at my family tree<br>
    I'm tryna make sure I contribute for the legacy<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    [Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]<br>
    Once again, the clouds are gatherin' to release what they held in (Again-again, once again)<br>
    Once again, the clouds are gatherin' to release what they held in<br>
    <br>
    [Outro: Kanye West]<br>
    Once again, the clouds are gathering to release what they held in (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)<br>
    Once again, the clouds are gathering to release what they held in (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)<br>
    Once again, the clouds are gathering to release what they held in (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)<br>
    Once again, the clouds are gathering to release what they held in (Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)<br>
